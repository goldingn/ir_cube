# How predictive skill depends on how far the held-out record sits from the
# training data.
#
# Each cross-validation experiment reduces to a single number, but the folds
# differ enormously in difficulty: a held-out record two cells from a training
# record is a different problem from one 800 km away. Reporting skill against
# distance and against local data volume turns each fold set into a continuum of
# difficulty rather than one summary, makes the arbitrary geometry of the folds
# matter less, and answers directly the question a user of the map has — at what
# separation, and at what data density, should the mechanistic model be trusted
# over local interpolation (#12 review).
#
# Three axes, for every held-out record:
#
#   distance to the nearest training record of the same insecticide, in km
#   number of training records of the same insecticide within `radius_km`
#   years since the most recent training observation at that same pixel
#
# Distances are between pixel centroids, because the pixel is the unit the model
# predicts at. Sourcing this file needs only the fold definitions and the saved
# scores; nothing is refitted.
