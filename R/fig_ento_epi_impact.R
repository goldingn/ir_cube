# Plot the decline (2000-2025 and projected 2025-2030) in the effectiveness of

# four panel plot:

# A) Declining effectiveness of nets: timeseries with ribbon of uncertainty
# (from Tas' estimates) giving average effectiveness of nets across Africa,
# relative to a fully susceptible population

# B) Declining impact of net distribution:
# plot the 'no resistance' line in the second plot
# add ribbon of uncertainty on Tas'

# C) Spatial variation in effectiveness: plot quantiles of IR (2025) on a map

# D) Significant spatial variation in impact of net distributions:
# plot overall impact of nets as averages in these quantiles

# Encode Symons et al. PMI function for relative effectiveness of ITNs at
# reducing logit-PfPR (reduction in on the log-odds ratio), compared to in the absence
# of resistance.

# when susceptibility is 100%, the ITN effectiveness parameter has full effect
# (multiplier 1), when susceptibility is 0%, the ITN effectiveness parameter has
# 54% (multiplier 0.54).

# compute the relative epi impact from the posterior mean of the parameters
epi_function_mean <- function(susceptibility) {

}

# The log-odds ratio for malaria infection under full ITN coverage (relative to
# no ITN coverage) is -1.68, which corresponds to an odds ratio of 0.186374.
# With a fully-resistant vector population, this is would reduce to 54% of its
# previous value, -0.9072, giving an odds ratio of 0.4036529.

# Alternative interpretation: the odds ratio for a population with 100% coverage
# and 100% resistance is equivalent to that of a population with 54% coverage
# and 0% resistance.

# get the estimate and SD. for the parameters behind this model, to be able to
# propagate variance through the subsequent calculations

# beta_0 = beta_{physical} = 'ITN_physical'
#   beta_0 ~ N(-1.68, 0.11^2)
# beta_1 = beta_{penalty} = 'ITN_insecticidal_penalty'
#   beta_1 ~ N(0.78, 0.12^2)

# the log odds (contribution to the linear predictor) is computed from these
# parameters, with a non-linear function of ITN coverage f(ITN) and
# susceptibility k:

#   log_odds = beta_0 * f(ITN) + beta_1 * (1 - k) * f(ITN)
#            = f(ITN) * (beta_0 + beta_1 * (1 - k))

# we can therefore factorise to get a net effectiveness measure g(k):
#   log_odds = f(ITN) * g(k)
#   g(k) = beta_0 + beta_1 * (1 - k)

# from which we can obtain a *relative* net effectiveness, giving the
# effectiveness relative to a fully susceptible population (k = 1):
#   g*(k) = g(k) / g(1)

# since:
#   g(1) = beta_0 + beta_1 * (1 - k)
#        = beta_0 + beta_1 * 0
#        = beta_0
# we have:
#   g*(k) = g(k) / beta_0
#         = (beta_0 + beta_1 * (1 - k)) / beta_0
#         = 1 + (beta_1 * (1 - k)) / beta_0

# this is equivalent to a ratio of normal distributions, but with non-zero means
# it doesn't have a closed form (that I know of), so I will compute credible
# intervals of effectiveness by Monte Carlo simulation.
