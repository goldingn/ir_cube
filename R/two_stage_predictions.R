# Predictions of the two-stage model (#21) at any mask cells and years, from

# (outputs/two_stage/maps/<type>/fit.rds and dynamical.rds). Used by the map
# step of R/two_stage_maps.R and by the figure scripts. Functions only; source
# from the repo root after R/packages.R. Sources the two-stage and dynamical
# prediction code it builds on.
#
# Draw d pairs dynamical draw d with a latent draw from N(mode, H^-1), shifted
# by the cut-posterior formula for it (correction_node_draws()). The target is
# m + omega + xi on the logit scale. u and p are observation-level noise: they
# enter only predictions of new assays, as fresh draws (noise = TRUE).
