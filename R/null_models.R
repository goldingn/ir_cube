# Null model definitions used in the cross-validation experiments: the
# insecticide-type intercept model and the nearest neighbour heuristic.
#
# Separated from the scoring so that both the point-prediction
# scoring and the posterior predictive scoring (#10) use one definition of each
# null model. The lower half of this file adds predictive distributions for the
# nulls, because a proper scoring rule needs a distribution rather than a point
# from every candidate. Every model is scored at the same external,
# replicate-based overdispersion (see validation_metrics.R).
#
# The nulls do not fit an overdispersion of their own. They earn their place on
# point prediction - mean squared error and variance explained - and that needs
# only the predicted fraction, while the dynamical model's calibration is judged
# against held-out data directly. Fitting one rho per null made coverage a
# comparison of vagueness rather than of prediction: the intercept null reached
# nominal coverage by inflating its rho to 0.45 against an external estimate of
# 0.12-0.22 (#12 review).

# approximate non-zero and non-one proportions by applying the empirical logit
# transform to the data and then the inverse logit to provide a proportion

# Pooled counts over the nearest neighbours of each held-out record - died and
# tested summed over them, rather than a single proportion, so that uncertainty
# in the predicted fraction can be represented by a beta posterior on those
# counts.
#
# Several neighbour counts at once. Neither the distance matrix nor the
# per-record ordering of those distances depends on k, so both are computed once
# and every k is read off the same cumulative sums. nn_oracle_draws() used to
# call this once per candidate k and pay for the full distance matrix and a sort
# per record fifteen times over (#12 review).
#
# `k_values` is a vector; the returned matrices have one row per held-out record
# and one column per element of it, in that order.

# surveys. Tuning it separately for each experiment would build a series of new
# models to compare against the one model under analysis, so it is not tuned at
# all. Two specifications are reported instead, and neither involves a chosen
# value:
#
#   the practice baseline - `n_neighbours = 1`, `n_years_prior = 1`: the single
#     nearest record in the most recent two years available at prediction time.
#     Short recency is justified a priori, since anyone running this
#     surveillance knows resistance is moving fast, and the k-curves agree.

#     number of neighbours minimises its own error on the held-out records. It
#     answers a different question, how well any such rule could have done in
#     this test, and a bound is properly per-test.
#
# This replaces a tuned `n_neighbours` read from outputs/optimal_nn.csv. That
# was chosen on an internal test set of 100 records sampled at random from the
# training data, which sat a median of 0 km from their nearest usable neighbour
# - 26% of them at the same site - while the held-out records sit at 36 km
# (interpolation), 139 km (blocks) and 194 km (countries). Optimal k rises with
# the distance that has to be reached, so tuning at 0 km chose it too small and
# handicapped the baseline. The lookup also had no row for the block folds,
