# Are the replicate bioassay groups representative of the data as a whole?
#
# Bioassays carried out in the same 5km pixel, in the same year, with the same
# insecticide, are replicate measurements of a single population susceptible
# fraction, so the variation between them identifies the observation
# overdispersion without reference to any spatial model. That makes the
# resulting rho an external quantity: it can be compared with the rho estimated
# inside the dynamical model, and it sets the noise floor against which
# out-of-sample predictive performance is judged (see idem-lab/ir_cube#10).
#
# rho itself is estimated in fig_illustrate_bioassay_variability.R and read back
# by rho_lookup(). This script asks only whether the groups it rests on look
# like the rest of the data. A quadrature-based marginal likelihood for rho once
# sat here as a second estimator; nothing ever called it, and it is gone (#12
# review).
